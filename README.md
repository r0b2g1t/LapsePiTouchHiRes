**Prerequisites:**

You must have gone through the [Adafruit PiTFT setup instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-3-dot-5-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi).

You must have gone through the [WiringPi-Python Setup instructions](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python).

**Get repo:**

    git clone https://github.com/r0b2g1t/LapsePiTouch.git


**Usage:**

    cd LapsePiTouch

    sudo python lapse_hi.py

Once youve got that working, have the Pi boot straight into the time-lapse software by editing /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart file:

	@lxterminal -e /home/pi/lapsepiplauncher.sh

And create the script /home/pi/lapsepiplauncher.sh by adding the the following lines:

	#!/bin/sh
	cd LapsePiTouch
	sudo python lapse_hi.py
